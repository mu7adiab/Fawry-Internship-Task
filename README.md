## Q1: Custom Command (mygrep.sh)

### Reflective Section

#### 1. How does your script handle arguments and options?

- I used `getopts` to parse command-line options (-n, -v).
- The script sets flags (`show_line_numbers` and `invert_match`) based on the options.
- After parsing options, it shifts positional arguments and checks that both a search string and filename are provided.
- It validates if the given file exists.
- Based on the flags, it either shows matching lines normally, shows line numbers, or inverts the match.

#### 2. How would the structure change if regex or -i/-c/-l options were added?

- For regex, I would replace the simple `grep` check with an extended regex match (`grep -E`) or shell pattern matching (`[[ $line =~ $pattern ]]`).
- For `-i` (ignore case), the structure would not change because case-insensitive search is already done using `grep -i`.
- For `-c` (count matches), I would add a counter variable that increments on each match and print the count at the end.
- For `-l` (list filenames), I would only print the filename once if there is at least one match instead of printing lines.
- I would modularize the script into small functions to make it easier to maintain when adding more options.

#### 3. What part of the script was hardest to implement and why?

- The hardest part was correctly parsing options (-v, -n, combinations like -vn).
- Ensuring the logic for inverted matches with line numbers was tricky, especially when combining both options.
- Using `getopts` and shifting positional parameters cleanly also required careful handling to avoid wrong arguments.

#### Bonus Features

- Added support for `--help` flag to print usage instructions.
- Improved command-line option parsing using `getopts` for cleaner and more efficient handling of `-n` and `-v` options.

## Q2: Internal Service Unreachable (Troubleshooting internal.example.com)

- **Verified DNS** with `dig` (local and 8.8.8.8)
- **Diagnosed service** with `curl` and `telnet`
- **Listed possible causes**
- **Applied fixes** for DNS, firewall, services
- **Bonus**: Used `/etc/hosts` and `systemd-resolved`

#### Screenshots

- See folder screenshots.

### 1. DNS Verification

- Used `dig` to check DNS resolution locally and via 8.8.8.8.
- Observed that local DNS failed to resolve, while Google DNS also did not find it.
- **Conclusion**: Likely an internal DNS or network misconfiguration.

### 2. Service Reachability

- Used `curl` and `telnet` to check port 80 and 443 connectivity.
- Found that `telnet` could not connect (connection refused).
- Used `netstat` to check if the web server is listening â†’ Web service was **NOT** listening on external interfaces.

### 3. Possible Causes

- **DNS**: Incorrect `/etc/resolv.conf`, DNS server down, internal-only domain
- **Network**: Firewall blocking ports, wrong routes
- **Service**: Web server down, misconfigured binding to 127.0.0.1

### 4. Solutions Applied

| Problem                | Confirmation               | Fix                                        |
|------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| DNS wrong server       | `cat /etc/resolv.conf`     | Updated to correct DNS IP                 |
| Service not listening  | `ss -tuln`                 | Updated server config and restarted web service |
| Firewall blocking       | `sudo ufw status`          | Allowed ports 80/443                      |
